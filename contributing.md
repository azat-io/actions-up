## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for new features
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

Example test:

```typescript
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest'
import { parseActionReference } from '../core/parsing/parse-action-reference'

describe('parseActionReference', () => {
  it('parses external action reference correctly', () => {
    // Arrange
    let reference = 'actions/checkout@v3'

    // Act
    let result = parseActionReference(reference, 'test.yml', 1)

    // Assert
    expect(result).toEqual({
      type: 'external',
      name: 'actions/checkout',
      version: 'v3',
      file: 'test.yml',
      line: 1,
    })
  })
})
```

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use `let` instead of `const` for variables
- Use explicit types where helpful
- Prefer early returns
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Formatting

- 2 spaces for indentation
- No semicolons
- Single quotes for strings
- Trailing commas in multiline structures
- Max line length: 80 characters

### File Naming

- Kebab case for files: `check-updates.ts`
- PascalCase for types/interfaces: `GitHubAction`
- camelCase for functions/variables: `checkUpdates`

## Security

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. Email security details to the maintainer
3. Allow time for patch before disclosure

## Release Process

Maintainers handle releases:

1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create git tag
4. Publish to npm
5. Create GitHub release
