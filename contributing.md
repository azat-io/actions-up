### Available Scripts

```bash
# Build
pnpm build          # Build the project (Vite)

# Full test suite
pnpm test           # Runs all test:* scripts

# Focused checks
pnpm test:unit      # Unit tests with coverage (Vitest)
pnpm test:js        # ESLint
pnpm test:types     # TypeScript type check (no emit)
pnpm test:format    # Prettier formatting check
pnpm test:spelling  # Spell check (cspell)
pnpm test:usage     # Unused files/exports/deps (knip)
pnpm test:packages  # Dependency dedupe check

# Local CLI run (after build)
node bin/actions-up.js --help
```

Note: A `dev` command is not used in this repo. Build, then run the CLI via `node bin/actions-up.js` for local testing.

## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for new features
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

Example test:

```typescript
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest'
import { parseActionReference } from '../core/parsing/parse-action-reference'

describe('parseActionReference', () => {
  it('parses external action reference correctly', () => {
    // Arrange
    let reference = 'actions/checkout@v3'

    // Act
    let result = parseActionReference(reference, 'test.yml', 1)

    // Assert
    expect(result).toEqual({
      type: 'external',
      name: 'actions/checkout',
      version: 'v3',
      file: 'test.yml',
      line: 1,
    })
  })
})
```

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use `let` instead of `const` for variables
- Use explicit types where helpful
- Prefer early returns
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Formatting

- 2 spaces for indentation
- No semicolons
- Single quotes for strings
- Trailing commas in multiline structures
- Max line length: 80 characters

### File Naming

- Kebab case for files: `check-updates.ts`

## Security

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. Email security details to the maintainer
3. Allow time for patch before disclosure

## Release Process

Maintainers handle releases using automated scripts and CI:

1. Ensure main is green: `pnpm test` and `pnpm build`
2. Run the release flow: `pnpm release`
   - Runs checks, bumps version and updates `changelog.md`
   - Commits, tags, and pushes (`vX.Y.Z`)
3. CI on tag creates a GitHub Release and publishes to npm
   - See `.github/workflows/release.yml` and `ci:*` scripts in `package.json`

No manual `npm publish` is needed locally.

## Tips

- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits. A commit-msg hook is configured via `simple-git-hooks`. To enable hooks locally after install, run: `pnpm exec simple-git-hooks`.
- Use `pnpm` v10 to ensure script features like regex runs (e.g. `pnpm run /^test:/`).
